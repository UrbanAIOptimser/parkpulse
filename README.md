# ParkPulse
A solution aimed at simplifying your parking experience in urban areas through predictive analytics. Your feedback is invaluable as we strive to meet your needs.

Hypothesis: Through the integration of data from diverse sources such as PaCaBa, electric chargers, Barcelona Parking Traffic datasets, satellite imagery, and parking data, we aim to construct a predictive model that enhances parking space discovery for drivers. This model will leverage machine learning algorithms to accurately forecast parking availability, quantifying the impact on driver convenience and reducing search time by an estimated 30%.Moreover, we anticipate that the implementation of this predictive model will lead to a notable enhancement in operational efficiency for businesses. Specifically, we project a 20% improvement in office space allocation and a 15% optimization in customer flow dynamics. These advancements are expected to translate into tangible benefits for stakeholders, particularly in the real estate and commerce sectors, by streamlining operations and enhancing overall businessÂ performance.
