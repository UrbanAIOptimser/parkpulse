It's an analysis of the traffic in the first 3 months of the year 2024 + traffic prediction model (it's classification because the current traffic status is categorical) with an accuracy of 79%.  
So the next step is to improve the performance of the model (also find a way to merge all the traffic data from 2021 to 2024).  
At the moment, at the end of this file there is the merging of the 2024 traffic with the parking data, but the paking data we have now are until 2023, so now we can't merge them.
